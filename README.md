# expense-tracker
This repository demonstrates how I apply Agile Project Management and Scrum practices to deliver a fintech solution.
The project simulates the development of a Personal Expense Tracker application, where users can log expenses, categorize spending, and gain insights into personal finance.
Rather than focusing only on code, this repository highlights my role as a Technical Project Manager / Scrum Master in guiding the project from initiation to delivery.
